  "description": "Kinematica is a next-generation character animation system.\n\nThis technology provides a solution for character animation that does not rely on animation graphs while achieving a higher level of quality and at the same time offers the same level of control, versatility and flexibility.\n\nKinematica allows the use raw animation clips or motion capture data directly without the necessity to organize them in an animation graph. Describe the intended movement of your character and Kinematica produces the corresponding poses automatically.\n\nAt the heart of Kinematica lies a considerably improved version of Motion Matching that achieves a near constant time lookup for arbitrary complex motion databases and does not rely on parameter tweaking or magic numbers.",
