# Traverser
### *By Aitor Simona*

Traverser is a player traversal toolkit featuring as of now the most basic traversal abilities which are Locomotion, Parkour and Climbing. It is self-contained in a set of scripts and has no dependencies apart from the basic Unity functionality. Use the given abilities or expand the system through its shared ability workflow.

## HOW TO USE 

### DOWNLOADING

In github, click on Code and copy the git URL. Go to Unity's Package manager, and add the package through this git URL. Unity's package manager will automatically
download the files and add them to your project. Note that this way puts the package in the package cache, and thus ends up being read-only. You can easily 
move the whole folder com.aitorsimona.traverser to the Packages folder, while renaming it to not containg anything after the @. 

You can also download the master branch as a ZIP and in Unity add the package from disk, or 
drop all files inside the Packages folder, under a newly created parent folder called com.aitorsimona.traverser.

You could also drop all the files in the Assets folder, and remove the unneeded package files such as package.json. 

### DEMO

Once you install the package, you will notice that the package manager shows a Samples drop down,
inside there is a downloadable demo which contains a demo scene and the required assets to showcase
the package's functionality. Some abilities may ask for animations found in this demo, which of course
can be replaced (I use them in development). 

IMPORTANT: The demo uses Cinemachine and the HDRP, make sure to install them first or all materials
will look pink and there will be missing scripts. 

### INPUT

Unfortunately Unity's current default input manager does not allow to create entries directly from code, so you have to do this yourself.

Create input entries in Edit->ProjectSettings->InputManager.

Xbox-like gamepads supported, the script TraverserInputLayer uses the following bindings.
