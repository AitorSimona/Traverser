# Animation Rigging

Use Animation Rigging to create and organize sets of constraints to address your rigging needs. For example, you can create deform rigs with procedural secondary animation to control character armor, props, and accessories. You can create world interaction rigs (sets of IK and Aim constraints) for interactive adjustments, targeting, and animation compression correction.

This documentation describes how to setup a simple Animation Rig. This documentation also includes detailed information on the constraints included in the Animation Rigging package.

To get started, consult [Rigging Workflow](RiggingWorkflow.md) for the main components necessary for defining and using an Animation Rig. The Rigging workflow topic includes suggestions on additional components and constraints that you can define for props, accessories, or additional rig controls. 

The [Animation Rigging Menu](AnimationRiggingMenu.md) topic describes utilities that help with the rigging workflow. The [Bidirectional Motion Transfer](BidirectionalMotionTransfer.md) topic describes an additional workflow option for transferring motion back and forth between an animation rig and a skeleton.

The Animation Rigging package includes predefined constraints for defining your own animation rigs. See [Constraint Components](ConstraintComponents.md) for detailed information on each predefined Constraint component.
