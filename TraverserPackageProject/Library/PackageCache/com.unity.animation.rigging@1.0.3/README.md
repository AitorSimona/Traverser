# Animation Rigging

The Animation Rigging package exposes a set of predefined constraints and tools to manually build a control rig hierarchy. At runtime, rig constraints are converted to a list of IAnimationJobs which are appended to the Animator playable evaluation.

Detailed information on how best to use this package can be found [**here**](./Documentation~/AnimationRigging.md).
