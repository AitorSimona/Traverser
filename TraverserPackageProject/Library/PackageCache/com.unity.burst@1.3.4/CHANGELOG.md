- Fixed an issue where Burst was misidentifying F16C supporting CPUs as AVX2.
- SDK level bumped for MacOS to ensure notarization requests are compatable.
- Fixed a typo `m256_cvtsi256_si32` -> `mm256_cvtsi256_si32` and `m256_cvtsi256_si64` -> `mm256_cvtsi256_si64`.
- The compiler is now generating a proper compiler error if a managed type used directly or indirectly with SharedStatic<T>.
- Fixed a bug where implicitly stack allocated variables (`var foo = new Foo();`) in Burst were not being zero initialized, so any field of the variable that was not initialized during construction would have undefined values.
- Fix potential race condition when accessing on-disk library cache

### Added
- Added support for `System.Threading.Volatile` methods `Read` and `Write`, and for the `System.Threading.Thread.MemoryBarrier` method.
- New FMA X86 intrinsics. These are gated on AVX2 support, as our AVX2 detection requires the AVX2, FMA, and F16C features.
- `UnsafeUtility.MemCmp` now maps to a Burst optimal memory comparison path that uses vectorization.

### Removed

### Changed

### Known Issues

## [1.3.0-preview.10] - 2020-04-21


### Fixed

- variable scopes should now encompass the whole scope.
- variables in parent scopes should now be present in locals windows.
- Native plugin location for windows has changed in 2019.3.9f1. If you are on an older version of 2019.3 you will need to upgrade for burst to work in windows standalone players.
- Added an error if `Assert.AreEqual` or `Assert.AreNotEqual` were called with different typed arguments.
- Fixed a bug where doing an explicit cast to a `Unity.Mathematics` vector type where the source was a scalar would fail to compile.
- Fix issue when converting large unsigned integer values to double or float.

- Button layout of disassembly toolbar tweaked.
- Copy to clipboard now copies exactly what is shown in the inspector window (including enhancements and colours if shown)
- AVX2 now generates the correct AVX2 256-bit wide SLEEF functions instead of the FMA-optimized 128-bit variants.

### Added
- Anonymous types are now named in debug information.
- XCode/LLDB debugging of burst compiled code is now possible on macOS.
- Added some extra documentation about how to enable `AVX`/`AVX2` in AOT builds, and how we gate some functionality on multiple instruction sets to reduce the combinations exposed underneath.
- Optimized external functions (like `UnsafeUtility.Malloc`) such that if they are called multiple times the function-pointer address is cached.
- Add support for string interpolation (e.g `$"This is a string with an {arg1} and {arg2}"`).
- Add support for Debug.Log(object) (e.g `Debug.Log("Hello Log!");`).
- Add support for string assignment to Unity.Collections.FixedString (e.g `"FixedString128 test = "Hello FixedString!"`).
- If burst detects a package update, it now prompts a restart of Unity (via dialog). The restart was always required, but could be missed/forgotten.
- Better error message for unsupported static readonly arrays.
- Link to native debugging video to Presentations section of docs.
- Fixes a bug where `in` parameters of interfaces could sometimes confuse the Burst inspector.

### Removed

### Changed
- iOS builds for latest xcode versions will now use LLVM version 9.
- Burst AOT Settings now lets you specify the exact targets you want to compile for - so you could create a player with SSE2, AVX, and AVX2 (EG. _without_ SSE4 support if you choose to).
- Improve speed of opening Burst Inspector by up to 2x.
- Provided a better error message when structs with static readonly fields were a mix of managed/unmanaged which Burst doesn't support.

- Load Burst Inspector asynchronously to avoid locking-up Editor.
- Documented restrictions on argument and return types for DllImport, internal calls, and function pointers.

### Known Issues

## [1.3.0-preview.9] - 2020-04-01


### Changed
- Improved the compile time performance when doing `UnsafeUtility.ReadArrayElement` or `UnsafeUtility.WriteArrayElement` with large structs.
- Made some compile-time improvements when indirect arguments (those whose types are too big that they have to be passed by reference) that reduced our compile time by 3.61% on average.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where storing a `default` to a pointer that was generic would cause an LLVM verifier error.
- Fixed an obscure bug in how struct layouts that had dependencies on each other were resolved.
- Fixed a bug as found by [@iamarugin](https://forum.unity.com/members/iamarugin.737579/) where LLVM would introduce ldexp/ldexpf during optimizations that LLD would not be able to resolve.
- Fixed a bug where the compiler would not promote sub-integer types to integers when doing scalar-by-vector math (like multiplies).

### Added
- Variable scopes are now constructed for debug information.

### Removed

### Known Issues

## [1.3.0-preview.8] - 2020-03-24


### Added
- Double math builtins in `Unity.Mathematics` now use double vector implementations from SLEEF.
- Fixed a bug with `lzcnt`, `tzcnt`, and `countbits` which when called with `long` types could produce invalid codegen.
- New F16C X86 intrinsics. These are gated on AVX2 support, as our AVX2 detection requires the AVX2, FMA, and F16C features.
- Add user documentation about generic jobs and restrictions.
- Add new experimental compiler intrinsics `Loop.ExpectVectorized()` and `Loop.ExpectNotVectorized()` that let users express assumptions about loop vectorization, and have those assumptions validated at compile-time.Enabled with `UNITY_BURST_EXPERIMENTAL_LOOP_INTRINSICS`.

### Changed
- Changed how `Unity.Mathematics` functions behave during loop vectorization and constant folding to substantially improve code generation.
- Our SSE4.2 support was implicitly dependent on the POPCNT extended instruction set, but this was not reflected in our CPU identification code. This is now fixed so that SSE4.2 is gated on SSE4.2 and POPCNT support.
- The popcnt intrinsics now live in their own static class `Unity.Burst.Intrinsics.Popcnt` to match the new F16C intrinsics.
- Deferred when we load the SLEEF builtins to where they are actually used, decreasing compile time with Burst by 4.29% on average.

### Fixed
- Fix an issue where a generic job instance (e.g `MyGenericJob<int>`) when used through a generic argument of a method or type would not be detected by the Burst compiler when building a standalone player.
- `[DlIimport("__Internal")]` for iOS now handled correctly. Fixes crashes when using native plugins on iOS.

- No longer log missing MonoPInvokeCallbackAttribute when running tests.

### Known Issues

## [1.3.0-preview.6] - 2020-03-12


### Added
- Experimental support for `Prefetch`, allowing users to request from the memory subsystem pointer addresses they intend to hit next. This functionality is guarded by the `UNITY_BURST_EXPERIMENTAL_PREFETCH_INTRINSIC` preprocessor define.

## [1.3.0-preview.4] - 2020-03-02


### Added
- Debug information for types.

- Support for `fixed` statements. These are useful when interacting with `fixed` buffers in structs, to get at the pointer data underneath.
- A fast-math optimization for comparisons that benefits the [BurstBenchmarks](https://github.com/nxrighthere/BurstBenchmarks) that [nxrightthere](https://forum.unity.com/members/nxrighthere.568489/) has put together.
- DOTS Runtime Jobs will now generate both `MarshalToBurst` and `MarshalFromBurst` functions when job structs in .Net builds are not blittable.
- DOTS Runtime Job Marshalling generation is now controllable via the commandline switch `--generate-job-marshalling-methods`.

### Removed

### Changed
- Made it clear that the Burst aliasing intrinsics are tied to optimizations being enabled for a compilation.
- Restore unwind information for all builds.
- Print a info message if compiling a function pointer with missing MonoPInvokeCallback attribute (this can lead to runtime issues on IL2CPP with Burst disabled). The message will be converted to a warning in future releases.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where DOTS Runtime generated job marshalling functiosn may throw a `FieldAccessException` when scheduling private and internal job structs.
- Fix a bug that prevented entry point method names (and their declaring type names) from having a leading underscore.
- vector/array/pointer debug data now utilizes the correct size information.
- DOTS Runtime will now only generate job marshaling functions on Windows, as all other platforms rely on Mono which does not require job marshalling.
- `ldobj` / `stobj` of large structs being copied to stack-allocated variables could cause compile-time explosions that appeared to the user like the compiler had hung. Worked around these by turning them into memcpy's underneath in LLVM.
- Don't always use latest tool chain on certain platforms.
- Fix a crash when compiling job or function pointer that was previously cached, then unloaded, then reloaded.
- Fixed compiler error in array element access when index type is not `Int32`.

## [1.3.0-preview.3] - 2020-02-12


### Changed
- Changed how the inliner chooses to inline functions to give the compiler much more say over inlining decisions based on heuristics.
- Updated AOT requirements to be clearer about cross platform support.

### Added
- 1.3.0-preview.1 added support for desktop cross compilation, but the changelog forgot to mention it.

### Removed

### Fixed

### Known Issues

## [1.3.0-preview.2] - 2020-02-10

### Fixed

## [1.3.0-preview.1] - 2020-02-04

### Added
- Enabled lower precision variants for `pow`, `sin`, `cos`, `log`, `log2`, `log10`, `exp`, `exp2`, and `exp10` when `BurstPrecision.Low` is specified.
- Add CPU minimum and maximum target for desktop platforms Standalone Player builds.
- Append a newline between IRPassDiagnostic messages, fixes pass diagnostics readability in the inspector.
- Add a new attribute `[AssumeRange]` that lets users tag function parameters and returns of an integer type with a constrained range that the value is allowed to inhabit. `NativeArray.Length` and `NativeSlice.Length` have automatic detection that the property is always positive. This assumption feeds into the optimizer and can produce better codegen.
- Enabled support for DOTS Runtime SharedStatics. Due to the nature of DOTS Runtime, only the generic versions of `SharedStatic.GetOrCreate<TContext>` are supported.
- Add a new intrinsic `Unity.Burst.Intrinsics.Common.Pause()` which causes a thread pause to occur for the current thread. This is useful for spin-locks to stop over contention on the lock.
- Add some new Burst aliasing deductions to substantially improve the aliasing detection in the compiler, resulting in better codegen.
- Add syntax colouring to WASM.
- Add `IsCreated` to the `FunctionPointer` class to allow checks on whether a given function pointer has a valid (non null) pointer within it.
- Add AVX2 intrinsics
- Add some missing intrinsics from SSE, SSE2 and AVX
- Added explicit X86 intrinsics from SSE-AVX2.
- AVX and AVX2 CPU targets are now available for x64 AOT builds.
- Allow handle structs (structs with a single pointer/integer in them) to be inside another struct as long as they are the single member, as these require no ABI pain.
- Added support for `Interlocked.Read`.
- Added a new intrinsic `Common.umul128` which lets you get the low and high components of a 64-bit multiplication. This is especially useful for things like large hash creation.
- Menu option to allow all burst jobs to be more easily debugged in a native debugger.

### Removed

### Changed
- Upgraded Burst to use LLVM Version 9.0.1 by default, bringing the latest optimization improvements from the LLVM project.
- Upgraded Burst to use SLEEF 3.4.1, bringing the latest performance improvements to mathematics functions as used in Burst.
- Improved Burst performance in the Editor by caching compiled libraries on-disk, meaning that in subsequent runs of the Editor, assemblies that haven't changed won't be recompiled.
- Update the documentation of `CompileSynchronously` to advise against any general use of setting `CompileSynchronously = true`.
- Take the `Unity.Burst.CompilerServices.Aliasing` intrinsics out of experimental. These intrinsics form part of our strategy to give users more insight into how the compiler understands their code, by producing compiler errors when user expectations are not met. Questions like _'Does A alias with B?'_ can now be definitively answered for developers. See the **Aliasing Checks** section of the Burst documentation for information.
- Align disassembly instruction output in Inspector (x86/x64 only).
- Renamed `m128` to `v128`.
- Renamed `m256` to `v256`.

- Fix reference version of AVX2 64-bit variable shifts intrinsics.
- Fix reference version of SSE4.2 `cmpestrz`.
- Fix bitwise correctness issue with SSE4.2/AVX explicit rounding in CEIL mode for negative numbers that round to zero (was not correctly computing negative zero like the h/w).
- Fix calls to `SHUFFLE`, `SHUFFLE_PS` and similar macro-like functions would not work in non-entrypoint functions.
- Source location information was offset by one on occasions.
- Debug metadata is now tracked on branch/switch instructions.
- Fix poor error reporting when intrinsic immediates were not specified as literals.
- Fix basic loads and stores (using explicit calls) were not unaligned and sometimes non-temporal when they shouldn't be.
- Removed the  `<>c__DisplayClass_` infix that was inserted into every `Entities.ForEach` in the Burst inspector to clean up the user experience when searching for Entities.ForEach jobs.
