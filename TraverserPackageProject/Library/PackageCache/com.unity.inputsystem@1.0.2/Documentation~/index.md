# Input System

The Input System package implements a system to use any kind of Input Device to control your Unity content. It's intended to be a more powerful, flexible, and configurable replacement for Unity's classic Input Manager (the `UnityEngine.Input` class).

To get started, see the [Installation](Installation.md) and [Quick Start Guide](QuickStartGuide.md) sections.
