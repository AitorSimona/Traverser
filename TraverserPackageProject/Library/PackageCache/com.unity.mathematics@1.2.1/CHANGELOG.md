### Internal (Not ready for production)

## [1.2.0] - 2020-08-03

### Added
* Added `[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)]` to many static functions to improve IL2CPP performance.
* Added `compress()` that accepts a `float4` and `uint4`.
* Added `math.project()` and `math.projectsafe()` for vector projection.
* Added `math.EPSILON`, `math.INFINITY`, `math.NAN` and their double counterparts.
* Added `[Serializable]` to `RigidTransform`.
* Added `math.ceillog2()`.
* Added `math.floorlog2()`.
* Added `math.down()`, `math.forward()`, etc for Cartesian coordinate axes that match UnityEngine Vector3 equivalents.
* Added `math.ispow2()`.
* Added `half.MinValueAsHalf` and `half.MaxValueAsHalf` to avoid having to explicitly convert from float.
* Added a `float3x3` constructor which takes a `float4x4` as input.
* Added `[Serializable]` to half types.
* Added some performance tests which can be run from the Unity test project.
* Added `Random.CreateFromIndex()` to assist in creating Random instances from loop indices.

### Changed
### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed
* Fixed documentation bug where `quaternion.RotateX/Y/Z` referred to a `float4x4` instead of quaternion.
* Fixed code generation bugs which could cause Windows and Mac to generate different test code.
* Fixed some test asserts which used NaNs and signed zeros which failed in IL2CPP builds.
* Updated documentation for `math.countbits()` to include equivalent names on Intel and ARM architectures to aid in discoverability.

### Internal (Not ready for production)
* Added `Unity.Mathematics.Geometry.Plane` to represent planes in 3D space.
* Added more `MinMaxAABB` functionality from `Unity.Physics.Aabb`.
* Added `Unity.Mathematics.Geometry.Math` to hold static functions like AABB transformations.
* Added `MinMaxAABB`.

## [1.1.0] - 2019-07-08

- Release stable version

## [1.1.0-preview.1] - 2019-06-27

- Add new math.bitmask to return a bit mask from a bool4

## [1.0.1] - 2019-04-15

- Release stable version
- Modify all math constants (e.g `math.PI`) to provide float constant by default instead of double. Use for example `math.PI_DBL` to get the previous double constant.

## [1.0.0-preview.1] - 2019-02-28

- Fixed bug where modifications on prefabs could not be reverted for vector properties when using context menu in Inspector.
- Fixed structure of the package for internal validation
