## [1.4.5] - 2020-11-19

### Fixed

- Fixed issue where changing a clip's extrapolation values would clear the current clip selection. ([936046](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/936046))
- Fixed multiple issues related to the curves view:
  - Fixed curve removal not functioning with `PlayableAsset`s (clips & tracks curves). ([1231002](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/1231002))
  - Fixed inconsistent icon display on curves.
  - Fixed incorrect ordering of properties. Properties now have a object/type/property ordering.
  - Fixed unnecessary grouping of fields.
  - Changed context menu from `Remove Properties` to `Remove Curves` to better reflect the change in functionality between curves for GameObjects and curves for `PlayableAssets`.
  - Fixed behaviour where removing a single field in a `Position`, `Rotation` or `Scale` group would remove the entire group.
- Fixed case where pausing in Playmode and switching the active director in editor could pause the director. ([1263707](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/1263707))
- Material properties are now displayed by their shader name in the curves view when possible. ([1115961](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/1115961))
